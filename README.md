# Advent of Code Solutions

Order solved:
2023 -> 2022 -> 2015 -> 2020 -> 2021

## 2015

Advancing knowledge of Kotlin, and focusing on using Sequences where possible
for efficiently generating answers.

## 2020

Less of a focus on pure immutability, but still using it plenty.
Flesh out support code for reuse in other years & challenges.

## 2021

Originally, I started AoC 2021 in Rust however I had set out to do it purely with
immutability. This ended up being a bad idea, especially with a limited knowledge
of the language at the time. Here on a number of years later, it's been completed
in Kotlin. There was also a larger focus on being able to generalize code for
re-use for use in future solutions.

## 2022

I originally started AoC 2022 in Clojure, and ported it
to Kotlin so that I could have a unified repo. So despite
2022 being solved after 2023, many of the solutions minimize
mutability and object-oriented features of Kotlin, as would
be standard in Clojure.

## 2023

AoC 2023 was an excuse to sit down and learn Kotlin, so the
solutions are very much non-object-oriented.
