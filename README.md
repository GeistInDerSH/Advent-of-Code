# Advent of Code Solutions

## 2015

Advancing knowledge of Kotlin, and focusing on using Sequences where possible
for efficiently generating answers.

## 2022

I originally started AoC 2022 in Clojure, and ported it
to Kotlin so that I could have a unified repo. So despite
2022 being solved after 2023, many of the solutions minimize
mutability and object-oriented features of Kotlin, as would
be standard in Clojure.

## 2023

AoC 2023 was an excuse to sit down and learn Kotlin, so the
solutions are very much non-object-oriented.
